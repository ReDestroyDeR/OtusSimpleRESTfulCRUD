OpenAPI

#### How to deploy this application in the Docker environment?

You can use `docker-compose up -d .` Additional information about Database credentials and other misc stuff can be found
inside the `docker-compose.yaml` file

#### How to deploy this application to the Kubernetes cluster?

0. Install [helm](https://helm.sh/)
1. Write `helm install simple-restful-crud helm/simple-restful-crud/ --values helm/simple-restful-crud/values.yaml` in
   the terminal. After installation process you can access the service via `arch.homework` URL. Only problem is that
   there is no Ingress-DNS configured so if you don't have, for example `/etc/hosts` mapping `Minikube IP`
   to that URL you won't be able to access it that way.
   <br>To add IP to `/etc/hosts` you can use provided script `./add-minikube-ip-to-hosts.sh`
   <br><br>P.S. There won't be a Windows solution (sry)
2. (Optional) You can pass `--namespace [namespace]` option to the `helm install` if you want to deploy in specific
   namespace
3. Uninstall: `helm uninstall simple-restful-crud`

#### Tests

You can use postman collection that is provided in this repo `Otus Homework #2 Tests.postman_collection.json`
It has tests written for each endpoint and collection variables that are preconfigured to work with `arch.homework` host
